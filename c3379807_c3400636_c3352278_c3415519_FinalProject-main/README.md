Group Assignment for SENG2050
----------------------------------------------------
If you expand src > main > resources, you will find:

	- The project configuration file application.properties. In this file we can provide configuration for our project.
	- A directory named ‘static’. We can place static web resources in this directory
	- A directory named ‘templates’. We can place our Thymeleaf templates here.
----------------------------------------------------
At the root of the project we have the build.gradle file. This is the gradle project configuration file. This file defines build plugins and dependencies used by the application. The most important part of this file is the ‘dependencies’ block – we can add more dependencies here to add additional features to our application. Please be careful when editing this file. The project can be easily broken if it is not maintained correctly.
----------------------------------------------------
In the top right hand corner when viewing the ‘C3379807C3400636C3352278C3415519FinalProjectApplication.java’ (?) file, we have a run option in the top right hand corner of the window. Later on, we will be running our application this this button.
